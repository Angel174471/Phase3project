Build a classifier to predict the primary contributory cause of a car accident, given information about the car, the people in the car, the road conditions etc. You might imagine your audience as a Vehicle Safety Board who's interested in reducing traffic accidents, or as the City of Chicago who's interested in becoming aware of any interesting patterns.

This is a multi-class classification problem. You will almost certainly want to bin, trim or otherwise limit the number of target categories on which you ultimately predict. Note that some primary contributory causes have very few samples, for example.
